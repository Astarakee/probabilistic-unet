# Probabilistic U-Net & Deep Probabilistic Modeling of Glioma Growth

This repository contains two things:

1. A generic PyTorch implementation of the [Probabilistic U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05034) that somewhat mirrors the signature of the [official implementation](https://github.com/SimonKohl/probabilistic_unet) in Tensorflow.
2. Code (but not data unfortunately) to reproduce the results of our paper "Deep Probabilistic Modeling of Glioma Growth" that was accepted at MICCAI 2019.
